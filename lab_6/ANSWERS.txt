WEEK 6 LAB - HOPFIELD NETWORKS
===============================

ASSIGNMENT ANSWERS
------------------

Problem 1: 10x10 Associative Memory
- Network: 100 neurons
- Patterns stored: 5
- Clean recall: 100% accuracy
- Noisy recall (20%): 80-89% accuracy

Problem 2: Network Capacity
- Theoretical capacity: ~14 patterns (0.138 * 100)
- Observed capacity: ~23 patterns
- Capacity ratio: 0.23

Problem 3: Error Correction Capability
ANSWER: The network can reliably correct 15-20% noise (bit flips)

At 20% noise: ~83% average accuracy
Beyond 30% noise: <70% accuracy

Error correction capability depends on:
- Number of stored patterns (fewer = better)
- Pattern distinctiveness
- Network size

Problem 4: Eight-Rook Problem

Energy Function:
E = A*sum(row_sum-1)^2 + B*sum(col_sum-1)^2 + C*(total-8)^2

Where:
- First term: one rook per row
- Second term: one rook per column
- Third term: exactly 8 rooks total

Weight Selection:
A = 2.0 (row constraint)
B = 2.0 (column constraint)
C = 1.0 (total count)

REASONING:
- A and B are equal to enforce row/column symmetry
- High values (2.0) create strong inhibition between conflicts
- C is lower (1.0) because it's redundant given A and B
- If each row has 1 rook AND each column has 1 rook, then total = 8 automatically
- The ratio 2:2:1 balances constraint satisfaction

Total weights: 4,096 (64x64 matrix)

Problem 5: TSP (10 cities)

ANSWER: 10,000 WEIGHTS

Calculation:
- Neurons: N x N = 10 x 10 = 100 neurons
- Each neuron x_i,j represents city i visited at position j
- Weights: N^2 x N^2 = 100 x 100 = 10,000

Network Parameters:
A = 500 (one city per position)
B = 500 (each city visited once)
C = 200 (total N cities)
D = 500 (distance minimization)

Weight matrix: 100x100 = 10,000 connections

SUMMARY
-------
Error correction: 15-20% noise
Eight-Rook weights: A=2, B=2, C=1 (symmetric constraints)
TSP weights: 10,000 total
